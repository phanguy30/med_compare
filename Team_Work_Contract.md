## Workflow and Version Control
To maintain professional standards:
- All code must be pushed through **Pull Requests**
- No direct commits to `main` branch
- Each feature must be developed in a separate branch
- All PRs require at least **one team member review**
- Clear commit messages are required
We agree not to overwrite or modify another member’s code without discussion.
## Task Distribution & Deadlines
- Tasks will be tracked using GitHub Projects or Issues
- Each task must:
    - Have a clearly assigned owner
    - Have a deadline
- If a member cannot complete a task, they must:
    - Notify the team early
    - Propose a solution or redistribution plan

Repeated failure to complete assigned work may result in redistribution of responsibilities.
## Conflict Resolution
If disagreements arise:
1. Discuss calmly within the team

3. If unresolved, consult instructor or TA
We agree to remain professional and respectful at all times.

Interactive Drug Identity & Comparison Dashboard
High-Level App Description

This interactive dashboard helps users understand whether two drug products are truly different or simply marketed differently. The app is designed for identity clarification and formulation comparison, not medical advice.

The interface begins with a search bar where users can enter a brand name, generic name, or active ingredient. The system normalizes the input to a standardized drug identity and retrieves its active ingredients.

After searching, the interface displays three coordinated panels:

Panel A — Drug Information Panel
This panel summarizes the selected drug, including its brand and generic names, active ingredients, pharmacologic class, and formulation type (single vs. combination). A toggle allows users to view a naming hierarchy that visually maps Ingredient → Generic → Brand relationships.

Panel B — Similarity Cluster View
A 2D similarity map displays related drug formulations based on ingredient composition. The searched drug is highlighted, and nearby drugs can be selected for comparison. This supports exploratory discovery.

Panel C — Ingredient Heatmap Comparison
When multiple drugs are selected, a heatmap appears showing ingredient presence across products. Rows represent drugs and columns represent ingredients, allowing users to quickly identify formulation overlap or differences.

An optional bar chart summarizes how many distinct formulations exist within a product group, helping users understand true formulation diversity.

The app emphasizes structured comparison across multiple coordinated visual panels rather than a single chart, supporting clear and realistic implementation within project scope.Interactive Drug Identity & Comparison Dashboard
